I’m @highkone
I’m interested in signal analysis, SDR, radio frequency and audio analysis
machine learning, edge computing.

I’m currently learning information theory, more advanced ways to prevent
overfit of the deep-learning and neural network models.

I’m looking to collaborate on open software, radio (including HAM) systems,
audio analytics and any interesting scientific/engineering problems.
